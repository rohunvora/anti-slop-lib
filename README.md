# 🚫 Anti-Slop

**Detect and prevent AI-generated "slop" aesthetic in web projects.**

You know the look: purple gradients, Inter font, floating 3D blobs, centered heroes. This library helps you avoid it.

## What is "Slop"?

"AI Slop" refers to the homogenized, generic aesthetic that emerges when websites are generated by AI tools without intentional design direction. Key markers include:

- 🟣 **Purple/indigo gradients** (the #1 offender)
- 📝 **Inter or Space Grotesk fonts** (everyone uses them)
- 🔮 **3D blobs and orbs** as decoration
- 🪟 **Glassmorphism** (backdrop-blur + transparency)
- 📐 **Centered everything** with excessive whitespace
- 🎴 **rounded-xl cards with shadow-md**
- 💬 **Generic copy** ("Transform your X", "AI-Powered Y")
